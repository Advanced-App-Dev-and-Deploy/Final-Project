# Final-Project
CS30 Final Project

**UNDERCONSTRUCTION**

# To Include

Purpose: intentionally using Class Design to create a project

Demonstration: using Pong or another project (not including the Face Assignment), create a Processing-Java or Processing-PureJava App using code to demonstrate the following ...
- Extension, Enrichment, and Increased Grades: prepare Processing-Java to run on an Android Device (Mr. Mercer is able to test this for you if you do not have an Android device)

Concepts (minimum expectations, including more will improve overall grade):
- Encapsulation: modifiers (this, public, private), getters & setters
- Multiple Constructors within one class created related objects, with slight differences
- Multiple Methods manipulating objects (variables) 
- Main Program directing how classes communication (optional, classes communicated directly with each other)
- Main Program Java Compiler requirements like setup() and draw() use local variables and objects stored in Array List for CANVAS visual data manipulation
- Main Program "Listeners" like keyboard or mouse use an Array List
- Inheritance Lines are mapped with FINAL for variables and methods
- Inheritance ensures variables are only declared once
- Inheritance ensures methods are only referenced unless specific lines must be overwritten
- Inheritance ensures all PUBLIC Methods ( including draw() only reference encapsulated procedures )

Mandatory:
- Version Control: New GitHub Repository is created immediately and updated daily to demonstrate consistent work (irregular updates will decrease overall grade)
- Immediate submission to Google FORM (late submissions will be viewed as intention not to participate in class, decreasing grade)
- All "Class Design" must be documented in GitHub's ReadMe.md file (to be referenced by Mr. Mercer)

ReadMe.md Expectations
- Purpose of Program
- Description of Program
- "Your" Interest in this Project ... state why you chose it
- All instructions on how to use app
- Finished feature list & Easter Eggs
- Unfinished feature list & Easter Eggs
- [BONUS]: use GitHub Markdown to organize and format documentation: https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Markdown-ReadMe-Documentation
